## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- The importance of max-width.
- Importance of css inheritance
- This is my second attempt at this challenge. I fixed the white space issue causing the boxes to not be centered.  I am definitely getting more comfortable with html and css. 

- There are still aspects of css still confuse me however.  I realize that the way  I think css is suppose to work at times is not how - css actually works. I need to work on that.
### Continued development

-Css inheritance

### Useful resources

- [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) -As always, mdn is an invaluable resource
